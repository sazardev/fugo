# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- More common Material widgets: `fg.Tooltip(message, child)`, `fg.Badge(child).Label(...)` (a dot when empty), `fg.CircleAvatar` (`.Text` / `.Icon` / `.BgColor` / `.Radius`), and `fg.SegmentedButton` (`.Item(value, label)`, `.Selected`, `.OnChange` with the selected value in the event data). (`fg.Spacer` already shipped as sugar over `Expanded`.)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Imperative overlays driven from Go over the out-of-band command channel (alongside window/host services): `ctx.ShowSnackBar(text)` shows a Material snackbar and `ctx.ShowDialog(title, message)` shows an alert dialog (dismissed with OK). (Pedido A wave 4 — completes the navigation/overlay series: AppBar, Drawer/NavigationBar, Tabs, Dialog/SnackBar.)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- `fg.Tabs` — a Material tab strip with one view per tab (`.Tab(label, content)`, `.InitialIndex`). Tab switching is handled on the client, so it needs no round-trip to Go. (Pedido A wave 3.)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- `Scaffold.Drawer(widget)` — a slide-in side panel (e.g. a `Column` of `ListTile`s). With an app bar present and no explicit leading, the menu button that opens it appears automatically.
- `fg.NavigationBar` — a Material 3 bottom navigation bar (`.Item(icon, label)`, `.Selected(i)`, `.OnChange` with the selected index in the event data), attached via `Scaffold.BottomBar(...)`. (Pedido A wave 2: navigation/layout.)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- `fg.AppBar` — a full Material app bar: a title plus an optional `.Leading` widget (e.g. a menu icon button), trailing `.Actions(...)`, `.CenterTitle`, and `.BgColor`. (First of the navigation/layout wave: AppBar → Drawer/NavigationBar → Tabs → Dialog/SnackBar.)

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `Scaffold.AppBar` now takes an `*fg.AppBar` widget instead of a title string, matching Flutter's `Scaffold(appBar: AppBar(...))`. Migrate `fg.Scaffold(body).AppBar("X")` → `fg.Scaffold(body).AppBar(fg.AppBar("X"))`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Flutter-style constant banks — stop hand-writing strings, hex and magic sizes:
  - **`fg.Icons.*`** — the full Material icon set (~2,200 base icons, e.g. `fg.Icons.Home`, `fg.Icons.Coffee`). Works with every icon-taking API (`fg.Icon`, `fg.IconButton`, `fg.FloatingActionButton`, `fg.ListTile`).
  - **`fg.Colors.*`** — the Material palette (`fg.Colors.Amber`, `.Blue`, `.RedAccent`, `.Grey800`, `.Transparent`, …).
  - **`fg.TextSize.*`** — the Material 3 type scale (`fg.TextSize.DisplayLarge` … `.LabelSmall`).
- `cmd/gen-icons`: a dev tool that regenerates `fg/icons_gen.go` and `flutter_client/lib/icons_gen.dart` from the installed Flutter SDK's `material/icons.dart` (base family).

### Changed
- The Flutter client resolves icon names through the generated `materialIcons` table instead of a hand-maintained ~20-icon switch, so any Material icon now renders.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- `fugo upgrade` — self-update the CLI to the latest release via `go install …@latest` (pass a version to pin, e.g. `fugo upgrade v0.4.2`). On Windows the running binary is moved aside (`<exe>.old`) so `go install` can replace it.

### Changed
- Repo hygiene: consolidated `.gitignore` so scratch artifacts never land in the tree — throwaway `fugo init` demo projects, manual-test screenshots and captured run logs belong under `.scratch/` (root-level `*.png` / `*.out` / `*.err` are ignored too). Documented the repository layout — including why Go tests live beside their package rather than in a separate folder — in `AGENTS.md`.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- `FloatingActionButton` now uses a unique hero tag per node, so an app can show multiple FABs (e.g. an increment and a decrement) without a Hero tag collision. Added the `remove` (minus) icon.

### Changed
- `fugo init`'s template is now a minimal, elegant counter: a centered count, an app bar titled "Fugo", and two FABs (decrement / increment). Nothing to tune — the shortest idiomatic Go + Flutter Material 3 demo.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- A `FloatingActionButton` fired its `OnClick` repeatedly on its own. The client wrapped every app in an outer `Scaffold`, so an `fg.Scaffold` with a FAB became a **nested** Scaffold, which misroutes the FAB's gestures. The outer surface is now a plain `Material`, leaving the app's own `Scaffold` as the only one.

### Changed
- Cleaner, flatter look: the client flattens the Material 3 seed-tinted surfaces to a neutral background (white in light, near-black in dark); the seed still colors interactive elements (buttons, FAB, switches).
- `fugo init`'s counter template is now the canonical responsive Material app — a `Scaffold` with an app bar, a centered count, and a floating action button — so it fills the window instead of leaving a small centered cluster.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Native **Material 3** rendering, **light by default**. The Flutter client builds its `ColorScheme` from the active `fg.Theme` (forwarded as `FUGO_THEME_SEED` + `FUGO_THEME_BRIGHTNESS`) via `ColorScheme.fromSeed`.
- Material button variants as separate constructors: `fg.FilledButton`, `fg.FilledTonalButton`, `fg.OutlinedButton`, `fg.TextButton`, `fg.ElevatedButton`, `fg.IconButton` (`fg.Button` is an alias of `FilledButton`). Buttons gain a leading `.Icon()` and `.Enabled()`.
- Core Material widgets: `fg.Card`, `fg.Scaffold` (`.AppBar` / `.FAB`), `fg.FloatingActionButton`, `fg.ListTile`, `fg.Chip`, and `fg.ProgressCircular` / `fg.ProgressLinear`.
- `fg.Column` alignment controls: `.MainAlign`, `.CrossAlign`, `.MainAxisSize`, `.Expand`.

### Changed
- The renderer **auto-centers** an intrinsically-sized root (e.g. a bare `Column`), so simple content lands in the middle of the window without an explicit `Center`. Roots that fill the viewport (`Scaffold`, `Container`, `ListView`, …) are left as-is.
- Widgets no longer inject opinionated hex colors: `Text`, `Container`, and `Button` inherit the Material 3 `ColorScheme` unless a color setter is called. The default theme is now `LightTheme`.
- `fugo init`'s counter template is now minimal (no manual colors or padding), relying on the Material 3 defaults and auto-centering.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- `LICENSE` file (MIT). The repository had no license file, so the module was non-redistributable and **pkg.go.dev hid the rendered documentation** ("License: None detected"). Adding the standard MIT text restores documentation on pkg.go.dev and matches the README's stated license.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- `fugo --version` now reports the correct version when the CLI is installed with `go install` (the Makefile's `-ldflags` are not applied in that path, so it previously printed the hardcoded `0.1.0`). It falls back to the module version and VCS stamps from `runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo()`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Installable via `go install`**: `go install github.com/sazardev/fugo/cmd/fugo@latest` now works. The generated protobuf Go bindings are committed, so a clean module-proxy fetch (or fresh clone) builds the CLI without `protoc` or any code-gen step. Added a README **Installation** section documenting the CLI install and the Flutter rendering prerequisite.
- OS host services: clipboard (`Context.Clipboard()`) and native file dialogs (`Context.Files().Open/Save`), answered asynchronously by the Flutter client and dispatched on the event goroutine.
- Runtime window control via `Context.Window()` (`window_manager`-backed): set title/size, minimize, maximize, center, fullscreen.
- New widgets: `fg.AnimatedPositioned` (animate a child between positions inside a `Stack`) and `fg.WindowDragArea` (make a region drag a frameless window).
- Scheduler immediate-priority path: `Context.UpdateNow()` wakes the render loop without waiting for the next 16ms tick.

### Changed
- Generated Go protobuf bindings (`transport/proto/fugo/v1/*.pb.go`) are **no longer gitignored** — they are committed and kept gofumpt-clean by `make proto` (which now runs `gofumpt -w` on the generated Go). The CI `format` job validates the committed bindings; lint/vet/build/test/bench still regenerate them via the `gen-proto` action to catch proto drift.
- Performance: object-pooled diff lookup map, GC tuning (`FUGO_GOGC` / `FUGO_GOMEMLIMIT`), and Go + Dart benchmarks behind a CI perf-regression gate.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- CLI DX overhaul: leveled verbose and quiet logging, animated steps, rich help, a widgets catalog, and a FUGO_LOG runtime logger

### Fixed
- Data race on `App.handlers` between the scheduler and transport goroutines (now mutex-guarded).
- Keyed diff desync: cross-frame `Key` matching emitted patches for node ids the client never received; node identity is now positional by id, so every patch is client-applicable.
- Text (font weight, alignment) and Container (per-edge padding) properties that were settable but never reached the wire.

### Changed
- Corrected the `CLAUDE.md` `ui`↔`fg` / `NewText` inversion and added FlatBuffers→Protobuf correction banners across the ROADMAP.
- Re-baselined performance budgets on standard protobuf with a deterministic zero-alloc diff gate; CI now regenerates the gitignored Go protobuf bindings via a composite action.
- Promoted `golang.org/x/term` and `golang.org/x/sys` to direct dependencies.
